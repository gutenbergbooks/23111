The Bookman he's a humming-bird,&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">He steals from song to song&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
He scents the ripest-blooming rhyme,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And takes his heart along</SPAN><BR>
And sacks all sweets of bursting verse<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And ballads, throng on throng.</SPAN><BR>

A humming-bird the Bookman is&mdash;<BR>

Ay, he's the featest humming-bird,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">On airiest of wings</SPAN><BR>
He poises pendent o'er the poem<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">That blossoms as it sings&mdash;</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
O friends of mine, whose kindly words come to me<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Voiced only in lost lisps of ink and pen,</SPAN><BR>
If I had power to tell the good you do me,<BR>
And how the blood you warm goes laughing through me,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">My tongue would babble baby-talk again.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And I would toddle round the world to meet you&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Fall at your feet, and clamber to your knees</SPAN><BR>
And with glad, happy hands would reach and greet you,<BR>
And twine my arms about you, and entreat you<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">For leave to weave a thousand rhymes like these&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A thousand rhymes enwrought of nought but presses<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of cherry-lip and apple-cheek and chin,</SPAN><BR>
And pats of honeyed palms, and rare caresses,<BR>
And all the sweets of which as Fancy guesses<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">She folds away her wings and swoons therein.</SPAN><BR>

A HOBO VOLUNTARY<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, the hobo's life is a roving life;<BR>
It robs pretty maids of their heart's delight&mdash;<BR>
It causes them to weep and it causes them to mourn<BR>
For the life of a hobo, never to return.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The hobo's heart it is light and free,<BR>
Though it's Sweethearts all, farewell, to thee!&mdash;<BR>
Farewell to thee, for it's far away<BR>
The homeless hobo's footsteps stray.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In the morning bright, or the dusk so dim,<BR>
It's any path is the one for him!<BR>
He'll take his chances, long or short,<BR>
For to meet his fate with a valiant heart.<BR>

Oh, it's beauty mops out the sidetracked-car,<BR>
And it's beauty-beaut' at the pigs-feet bar;<BR>
But when his drinks and his eats is made<BR>
Then the hobo shunts off down the grade.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He camps near town, on the old crick-bank,<BR>
And he cuts his name on the water-tank&mdash;<BR>
He cuts his name and the hobo sign,&mdash;<BR>
"Bound for the land of corn and wine!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
(Oh, it's I like friends that he'ps me through,<BR>
And the friends also that he'ps you, too,&mdash;<BR>
Oh, I like all friends, 'most every kind<BR>
But I don't like friends that don't like mine.)<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There's friends of mine, when they gits the hunch,<BR>
Comes a swarmin' in, the blasted bunch,&mdash;<BR>
"Clog-step Jonny" and "Flat-wheel Bill"<BR>
And "Brockey Ike" from Circleville.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
With "Cooney Ward" and "Sikes the Kid"<BR>
And old "Pop Lawson"&mdash;the best we had&mdash;<BR>
The rankest mug and the worst for lush<BR>
And the dandiest of the whole blame push.<BR>

Oh, them's the times I remembers best<BR>
When I took my chance with all the rest,<BR>
And hogged fried chicken and roastin' ears, too,<BR>
And sucked cheroots when the feed was through.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, the hobo's way is the railroad line,<BR>
And it's little he cares for schedule time;<BR>
Whatever town he's a-striken for<BR>
Will wait for him till he gits there.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And whatever burg that he lands in<BR>
There's beauties there just thick for him&mdash;<BR>
There's beauty at "The Queen's Taste Lunch-stand," sure,<BR>
Or "The Last Chance Boardin' House" back-door.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He's lonesome-like, so he gits run in,<BR>
To git the hang o' the world ag'in;<BR>

Makes him sigh for the country air,&mdash;<BR>

So it's Good-by gals! and he takes his chance<BR>

And strikes mud roads for a change of view.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The jay drives by on his way to town,<BR>
And looks on the hobo in high scorn,<BR>
And so likewise does the farmhands stare&mdash;<BR>
But what the haids does the hobo care!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He hits the pike, in the summer's heat<BR>
Or the winter's cold, with its snow and sleet&mdash;<BR>
With a boot on one foot, and one shoe&mdash;<BR>
Or he goes barefoot, if he chooses to.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But he likes the best, when the days is warm,<BR>
With his bum Prince-Albert on his arm&mdash;<BR>
He likes to size up a farmhouse where<BR>
They haint no man nor bulldog there.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, he gits his meals wherever he can,<BR>
So natchurly he's a handy man&mdash;<BR>
He's a handy man both day and night,<BR>
And he's always blest with an appetite!<BR>

Then he fills his pipe with a stub cigar<BR>

Only a boy&mdash;I loved him so!)<BR>
And ah, how pleasant he made it all!<BR>
And the things he knew that <I>I</I> should know!&mdash;<BR>
The stage, the "drop," and the frescoed wall;<BR>
The sudden flash of the lights; and oh,<BR>

For Uncle showed me the "Leader" there,<BR>
With his pale, bleak forehead and long, black hair;<BR>
Showed me the "Second," and "'Cello," and "Bass,"<BR>
And the "B-Flat," pouting and puffing his face<BR>
At the little end of the horn he blew<BR>
Silvery bubbles of music through;<BR>
And he coined me names of them, each in turn,<BR>
Some comical name that I laughed to learn,<BR>
Clean on down to the last and best,&mdash;<BR>
The lively little man, never at rest,<BR>
Who hides away at the end of the string,<BR>

Reeling ripples of riotous bells,<BR>
And tipsy tinkles of triangles&mdash;<BR>
Wrangled and tangled in skeins of sound<BR>
Till it seemed that my very soul spun round,<BR>
As I leaned, in a breathless joy, toward my<BR>
Radiant uncle, who snapped his eye<BR>
And said, with the courtliest wave of his hand,<BR>
"Why, that little master of all the band<BR>

Herr Weiser!&mdash;Threescore years and ten,&mdash;<BR>
A hale white rose of his countrymen,<BR>
Transplanted here in the Hoosier loam,<BR>
And blossomy as his German home&mdash;<BR>
As blossomy and as pure and sweet<BR>
As the cool green glen of his calm retreat,<BR>
Far withdrawn from the noisy town<BR>
Where trade goes clamoring up and down,<BR>
Whose fret and fever, and stress and strife,<BR>
May not trouble his tranquil life!<BR>

Breath of rest, what a balmy gust!&mdash;<BR>
Quit of the city's heat and dust,<BR>
Jostling down by the winding road<BR>
Through the orchard ways of his quaint abode.&mdash;<BR>
Tether the horse, as we onward fare<BR>
Under the pear trees trailing there,<BR>
And thumping the wooden bridge at night<BR>
With lumps of ripeness and lush delight,<BR>
Till the stream, as it maunders on till dawn,<BR>
Is powdered and pelted and smiled upon.<BR>

Herr Weiser, with his wholesome face,<BR>
And the gentle blue of his eyes, and grace<BR>
Of unassuming honesty,<BR>
Be there to welcome you and me!<BR>
And what though the toil of the farm be stopped<BR>
And the tireless plans of the place be dropped,<BR>
While the prayerful master's knees are set<BR>
In beds of pansy and mignonette<BR>
And lily and aster and columbine,<BR>
Offered in love, as yours and mine?&mdash;<BR>

I'm always just "Old Santa Claus,"&mdash;<BR>

WHEN OLD JACK DIED<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
When Old Jack died, we stayed from school (they said,<BR>
At home, we needn't go that day), and none<BR>
Of us ate any breakfast&mdash;only one,<BR>
And that was Papa&mdash;and his eyes were red<BR>
When he came round where we were, by the shed<BR>
Where Jack was lying, half-way in the sun<BR>
And half-way in the shade.  When we begun<BR>
To cry out loud, Pa turned and dropped his head<BR>
And went away; and Mamma, she went back<BR>
Into the kitchen.  Then, for a long while,<BR>
All to ourselves, like, we stood there and cried.<BR>
We thought so many good things of Old Jack,<BR>
And funny things&mdash;although we didn't smile&mdash;<BR>
We couldn't only cry when Old Jack died.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
When Old Jack died, it seemed a human friend<BR>
Had suddenly gone from us; that some face<BR>
That we had loved to fondle and embrace<BR>
From babyhood, no more would condescend<BR>
To smile on us forever.  We might bend<BR>
With tearful eyes above him, interlace<BR>
Our chubby fingers o'er him, romp and race,<BR>
Plead with him, call and coax&mdash;aye, we might send<BR>
The old halloo up for him, whistle, hist,<BR>
(If sobs had let us) or, as wildly vain,<BR>
Snapped thumbs, called "Speak," and he had not replied;<BR>
We might have gone down on our knees and kissed<BR>
The tousled ears, and yet they must remain<BR>
Deaf, motionless, we knew&mdash;when Old Jack died.<BR>

When Old Jack died, it seemed to us, some way,<BR>
That all the other dogs in town were pained<BR>
With our bereavement, and some that were chained,<BR>
Even, unslipped their collars on that day<BR>
To visit Jack in state, as though to pay<BR>
A last, sad tribute there, while neighbors craned<BR>
Their heads above the high board fence, and deigned<BR>
To sigh "Poor Dog!" remembering how they<BR>
Had cuffed him, when alive, perchance, because,<BR>
For love of them he leaped to lick their hands&mdash;<BR>
Now, that he could not, were they satisfied?<BR>
We children thought that, as we crossed his paws,<BR>
And o'er his grave, 'way down the bottom-lands,<BR>
Wrote "Our First Love Lies Here," when Old Jack died.<BR>

INTENDED FOR A DINNER OF THE INDIANA SOCIETY OF CHICAGO<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Old Indiany, 'course we know<BR>
Is first, and best, and <I>most</I>, also,<BR>
Of <I>all</I> the States' whole forty-four:&mdash;<BR>
She's first in ever'thing, that's shore!&mdash;<BR>
And <I>best</I> in ever'way as yet<BR>
Made known to man; and you kin bet<BR>
She's <I>most</I>, because she won't confess<BR>
She ever was, or will be, <I>less</I>!<BR>
And yet, fer all her proud array<BR>
Of sons, how many gits away!&mdash;<BR>

No doubt about her bein' <I>great</I>,<BR>
But, fellers, she's a leaky State!<BR>
And them that boasts the most about<BR>
Her, them's the ones that's dribbled out.<BR>
Law! jes' to think of all you boys<BR>
'Way over here in Illinoise<BR>
A-celebratin', like ye air,<BR>
Old Indiany, 'way back there<BR>
In the dark ages, so to speak,<BR>
A-prayin' for ye once a week<BR>
And wonderin' what's a-keepin' you<BR>
From comin', like you ort to do.<BR>
You're all a-lookin' well, and like<BR>
You wasn't "sidin' up the pike,"<BR>
As the tramp-shoemaker said<BR>
When "he sacked the boss and shed<BR>
The blame town, to hunt fer one<BR>
Where they didn't work fer fun!"<BR>
Lookin' <I>extry</I> well, I'd say,<BR>
Your old home so fur away.&mdash;<BR>

Maybe, though, like the old jour.,<BR>
Fun hain't all yer workin' fer.<BR>
So you've found a job that pays<BR>
Better than in them old days<BR>
You was on The Weekly Press,<BR>
Heppin' run things, more er less;<BR>
Er a-learnin' telegraph-<BR>
Operatin', with a half-<BR>
Notion of the tinner's trade,<BR>
Er the dusty man's that laid<BR>
Out designs on marble and<BR>
Hacked out little lambs by hand,<BR>
And chewed finecut as he wrought,<BR>
"Shapin' from his bitter thought"<BR>
Some squshed mutterings to say,&mdash;<BR>
"Yes, hard work, and porer pay!"<BR>
Er you'd kind o' thought the far-<BR>
Gazin' kuss that owned a car<BR>
And took pictures in it, had<BR>
Jes' the snap you wanted&mdash;bad!<BR>
And you even wondered why<BR>
He kep' foolin' with his sky-<BR>
Light the same on shiny days<BR>
As when rainin'.  ('T leaked always.)<BR>

Wondered what strange things was hid<BR>
In there when he shet the door<BR>
And smelt like a burnt drug store<BR>
Next some orchard-trees, i swan!<BR>
With whole roasted apples on!<BR>
That's why Ade is, here of late,<BR>
Buyin' in the dear old state,&mdash;<BR>
So's to cut it up in plots<BR>
Of both town and country lots.<BR>
